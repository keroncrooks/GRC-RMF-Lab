# 🛡️ RMF GRC Lab – Third-Party Risk Management

This repository showcases a practical application of the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) with a focus on Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM). It includes artifacts commonly used in Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) programs, especially within federal environments aligned with FISMA, FedRAMP, and ISO 27001.

## 📁 Files Included

- **RMF_Risk_Register_with_FIPS199.csv**  
  A risk register that documents identified cybersecurity risks along with impact categorizations (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) based on FIPS 199.

- **POAM_RMF_GRC_Lab.csv**  
  A sample Plan of Action & Milestones (POA&M) tracking mitigation strategies, responsible parties, and remediation timelines.

- **Control_Implementation_Table_RMF_Lab.csv**  
  A Control Implementation Table (CIT) outlining how specific NIST 800-53 controls are implemented across systems.

## 📌 Frameworks Referenced

- **NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5** – Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems  
- **FIPS 199** – Standards for Categorizing Information and Information Systems  
- **FedRAMP** – Cloud-specific security baseline based on NIST  
- **ISO/IEC 27001** – International standard for information security management systems  
- **FAIR** – Quantitative model for risk analysis (not shown here, but complementary)

## 🧪 Lab Use Case

This lab simulates the evaluation of third-party systems integrated into a federal environment, tracking:
- Initial risk identification
- Tiering based on sensitivity and impact
- Gap analysis using NIST 800-53
- Mitigation tracking via POA&M
- System-level control implementation documentation

## 🧠 Ideal For

- GRC Analysts
- Security Control Assessors (SCA)
- RMF Engineers
- Cybersecurity Risk Professionals
- Anyone building a practical GitHub portfolio in cybersecurity

## ✅ Next Steps (Optional Additions)

- System Security Plan (SSP) Sample
- Security Assessment Plan (SAP)
- Continuous Monitoring Strategy
- Risk Reporting Dashboard
