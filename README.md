# RMF-Based Third Party Risk Management Lab

This GitHub lab simulates a third-party cybersecurity risk management process modeled after NIST RMF (Risk Management Framework) principles. It walks through a full lifecycle: from impact categorization to risk tracking, remediation, control implementation, and process automation.

## üìÅ Included Files (In Workflow Order)

### 1. `FIPS199_Only_With_Rationale_And_Examples.csv`
Establishes the foundation for all risk decisions by categorizing information types according to FIPS 199 (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability). Each row includes a rationale and example for its impact rating, which guides all follow-on control selection and risk analysis.

### 2. `Risk_Register_Only.csv`
Captures individual risk entries tied to third-party activities, SIG responses, or control gaps. Fields include risk level, description, mitigation strategy, and ownership ‚Äî enabling prioritization and integration into ongoing reviews.

### 3. `POAM_RMF_GRC_Lab.csv`
Maps risks from the register into active remediation plans. Includes target resolution dates, responsible parties, and current status. Useful for governance meetings, audit trails, and tracking open control gaps.

### 4. `Control_Implementation_Table_RMF_Lab.csv`
Maps selected and tailored NIST 800-53 controls to the categorized system. Shows implementation rationale, control owners, and supporting evidence. Useful for SSP development or ATO preparation.

### 5. `IRS_Third_Party_Risk_Workflow_Automation_Template.csv`
Outlines a proposed automated workflow for third-party intake and assessment using tools like SharePoint, Power Automate, or ServiceNow. Focuses on automating intake, tiering, document requests, and reminders to reduce manual burden and improve consistency.

## ‚úÖ Purpose of This Lab

- Demonstrate how to implement a GRC-aligned third-party risk workflow from start to finish.
- Showcase familiarity with FIPS 199, NIST 800-53, POA&M handling, and automation planning.
- Simulate work typical of roles supporting FedRAMP, CMMC, or enterprise-level RMF programs.

## üóÇÔ∏è For Reviewers

This lab is a simulation and does not reflect real vendor data. It is designed to showcase initiative, practical RMF alignment, and documentation quality expected in GRC-focused roles.
